ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub profile!  I'm Pelin Keskin, a chemical engineer and recent computer science master's graduate with a passion for data science and machine learning. With a strong foundation in both domains, I bring a unique perspective to solving complex problems at the intersection of science, engineering, and technology.

Throughout my eight-year tenure in the pharmaceutical industry, I've had the opportunity to excel in non-technical managerial roles. These experiences have provided me with a deep understanding of the industry's challenges and the ability to navigate complex organisational structures. Furthermore, my MBA has equipped me with valuable business acumen, enabling me to bridge the gap between technical and strategic objectives.

Now, I'm eager to leverage my diverse background and pursue my passion for data science, analytics, and machine learning. I'm excited about the dynamic nature of these fields and the limitless opportunities they offer for innovation and problem-solving. I aim to contribute my technical expertise, analytical mindset, and leadership skills to make a meaningful impact in the data-driven world.

On my GitHub, you'll find a collection of projects that showcase my proficiency in data science and machine learning. From exploratory data analysis to predictive modelling and algorithm development, I enjoy diving into complex datasets, uncovering insights, and building robust models that drive actionable decisions.

I believe in the power of collaboration and open-source knowledge sharing. So, feel free to explore my repositories, contribute, and provide feedback. I'm always eager to learn from others and engage in meaningful discussions that push the boundaries of what's possible.

Let's connect and embark on this exciting journey together as we harness the power of data science, analytics, and machine learning to create a better future.
